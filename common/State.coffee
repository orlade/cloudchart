# The purpose of this global object is to provide a facade that unifies the two common use cases of
# recording the state of operations that affect multiple parts of the app, and performing reactive
# logic when properties of that state change.
#
# In order for changes to be recorded on both client and server sides, they are ultimately written
# to a collection that is published to the client. Since the syntax for reading from a collection is
# quite verbose in this simple case of a singleton document, the `State` object hides where the data
# is actually being read from.
